# Errors.po 

By default phoenix framework provides an ```errors.po``` file in English. Let's translate that file in different languages to be more productive with phoenix out of the box !

## How to help
If you want to translate that file in your native language, just send me a pull request. You should respect the ISO language code ( http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm ) when you set the name for the folder and the language option ```"Language: pt-BR\n"```

## Available Languages

| Code  | Name                |
|-------|---------------------|
| fr    | French              |
| pt-BR | Portuguese (Brazil) |
